# Getting started with the simulation
To get started:
- Clone this repository
- Install [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/)
- Open the `./worlds/*.wbt` file using the Webots software
    - If you get an error along the lines of could not find TurtleBot3Burger, then click the + button, search for TurtleBot3Burger, click add. It should now download the dependency. Then do **not** save the project, but restart it.
